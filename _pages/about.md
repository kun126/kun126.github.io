I’m a data science graduate from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en), currently working with [Data Pop Alliance](https://datapopalliance.org) on projects that tackle climate and gender issues—two causes I’m passionate about. For me, data isn’t just about numbers; it’s a powerful tool for change.

In 2022, I studied at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven) as an Erasmus student, an experience that broadened my perspectives and taught me the value of cross-cultural insights in problem-solving.

I’m always on the lookout for new tools and techniques to uncover fresh insights from data. Excited to [connect](kun.chen@studbocconi.it) with others who believe in data’s potential to make a difference!
