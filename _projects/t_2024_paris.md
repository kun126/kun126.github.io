Paris had always been at the top of my list, thanks to its vibrant museum scene and its unparalleled art treasures. I’ve been drawn to all things unconventional and intriguing, so when I heard that the Pompidou Centre would be closing for renovations from 2025 to 2030, I knew it was time to finally make the trip.

During my visit, I explored the Louvre, the Orangerie Museum, the Pompidou Centre, and the Orsay Museum. Like any art lover, I was excited to see the classics—the pieces that grace the pages of art history books. But what stuck with me most were the unexpected connections and little revelations that brought the art to life.

One of the most magical moments was standing at the real Saint-Lazare station, then seeing [Monet’s evocative depiction](https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/artworks/la-gare-saint-lazare-10897) of it on canvas. There was also something electrifying about viewing classical works like [Eva Prima Pandora](https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010063633) and [Grande Odalisque](https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010065566) before encountering the provocative [Olympia](https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/artworks/olympia-712)—a progression that felt like stepping through the evolution of boldness in art. Even the face-to-face setup of [Monet’s](https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/artworks/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe-25651) and [Manet’s](https://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/artworks/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe-904) Luncheon on the Grass made me think about the dialogue between their works. And finding Caravaggio’s [The Fortune Teller](https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010062329) here after seeing its twin in the Capitoline Museums felt like reuniting with an old friend. 

Another unexpected delight was discovering the vivid energy of Matisse’s bold colors and expressive brushstrokes. It reminded me of the playful spontaneity of Marimekko’s patterns—a connection that took me straight back to a previous trip.

Scrolling through my photos afterward, I noticed a surprising theme: I’d taken so many pictures of rooms, especially bedrooms. It got me thinking—how did artists choose to frame their personal spaces, and how different in their views of home? That could be an exciting theme for a new exhibition in the future.
