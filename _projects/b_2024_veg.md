At first, The Vegetarian by Han Kang pulls you into a world where the protagonist seems irrational, even mad. But as the story unfolds and shifts between perspectives, her choices begin to feel surprisingly ordinary, almost painfully relatable. Thereâ€™s a heartbreaking clarity in her actions, which slowly reveal that the real madness lies not within her but in the suffocating expectations of society. Reading this book is a strange experience, a blend of violence and poetry that draws you in. Beneath its piercing metaphors, what once seemed incomprehensible starts to make sense, and the story's surreal elements feel rooted in a haunting reality.
