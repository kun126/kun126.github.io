It’s a weekend trip to Vienna, and every single moment is so worth it. Visiting in autumn is a bit chilly, but this city has a way of making you feel warm and alive.

I’m filled with gratitude as I enjoy a fish box and wait to enter the [Sisi Museum](https://www.sisimuseum-hofburg.at/en/), when the waiter kindly hands me tissues without a word. Or the earplugs I was gifted by a local during a friendly chat at the place I’m staying. 

One of the highlights has definitely been [Albertina Modern](https://www.albertina.at/en/). What I love about modern art is how personal it can feel. Sometimes the connection you have with a piece is purely instinctive, or maybe it just sparks something in you that you didn’t expect. For example, I stood in front of one sculpture, and for some reason, I instantly thought I knew the name of the one next to it. When I checked and found I was right, it felt like a small, perfect moment of connection. Also, I realized I have a weird talent for picking out which artworks will become postcards at the museum shop.

I’ll end with this fun little exchange at Manner. I spotted a cute lighter (out of the usual Manner wafers), but I wasn’t sure if it would make it through airport security. In my hesitation, I turned to the couple behind me. The lady, with a smile, said, "Just take it. The worst that can happen is you throw it away at the airport, and you’ll have almost nothing to lose."  So true. Life moves quickly, and often times it’s worth taking a little risk. And yes, the lighter made it to Rome with me:D
