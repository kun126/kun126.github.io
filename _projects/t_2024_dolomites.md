During my exchange in Leuven, I fell in love with its clean, compact, and peaceful vibe. Everything was so convenient—a studio in the city center, just a 10-minute walk to the train station, and from there, Brussels Airport was only 20 minutes away. Despite being so well-connected, it was quiet enough to hear the bell tower chime every hour. Leuven felt like the perfect mix of modern comfort and tranquility.

But then, I discovered Bolzano.

Bolzano has everything I love in a place to live, with one huge bonus—its closeness to nature. The moment I arrived, I felt the same sense of belonging I had in Leuven. My heart whispered, *"You should live here."*

But exploring the Dolomites took it to another level. Every season here is magical. Weekends could mean hiking through stunning trails, picnicking by a lake, or just admiring the Alps. Horses, cows, rabbits, and goats roam freely, and even the dogs seem more alive in this fresh mountain air.

If Leuven stole my heart, Bolzano showed me how amazing life could be surrounded by mountains and endless exploration.
