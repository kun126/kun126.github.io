If you're looking for a sport that's easy to maintain but offers incredible benefits for both body and mind, running is it! As someone who's been an amateur runner for over five years and a fiction lover, I find it so inspiring to see Haruki Murakami's "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running" bring together the worlds of writing and running. It's the perfect blend of discipline and creativityâ€”two things that fuel not only writing, but pretty much any profession.
