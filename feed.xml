It’s like adding a special twist to your functions without complicating their core logic.</p> <p>Below is a simplified example to show how it works. In this example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my_decorator</code> is a decorator function that takes a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">func</code> as its argument and returns a new function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wrapper</code>. The wrapper function adds behavior after calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">func</code>. By decorating our target function with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@my_decorator</code>, we effectively create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">decorated_function</code> with the wrapped version provided by the decorator. When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">decorated_function</code> is called, it executes the additional logic defined in the decorator alongside its original functionality.</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="c1"># Without decorator

<span class="nf">decorated_function</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure> <p>Think of decorators as a way to neatly wrap up your functions or methods with extra features without cluttering them up. Normally, if you want to add something to a function, you tack it on after the function’s code. But when your functions start getting big, this can make it hard to understand what’s going on. Decorators address this by providing a cleaner way to add functionality to functions or methods. They essentially allow you to wrap your original function with additional behavior without altering its core implementation. This separation of concerns enhances readability and maintainability by keeping the main function’s logic distinct from the added features.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2> <h3 id="multiple-decorators">Multiple decorators</h3> <p>Python accepts multiple decorators, which are executed from bottom to top. This means that the decorator closest to the function declaration will be applied first, followed by the next decorator, and so on. For example:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="nd">@d2</span>
<span class="nd">@d1</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">func</span><span class="p">():</span>
	<span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="nf">func</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure> <p>is equivalent to:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="nf">d2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">d1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">func</span><span class="p">))()</span></code></pre></figure> <p>In both cases, the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">func</code> is decorated first with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d1</code> and then with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d2</code>, and finally, the decorated function is called. Here’s an important point to note: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d2</code> is not applied directly to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">func</code>, but rather to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d1-wrapped</code> version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">func</code>. This demonstrates the concept of decorators being nested within each other.</p> <h3 id="decorator-as-a-function-output">Decorator as a function output</h3> <p>You can also use a decorator as the output of a function. This allows for more dynamic behavior when decorating functions. Here’s how it works:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">decorator_func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">...):</span>

This technique allows for greater flexibility in creating decorators with varying behaviors based on arguments passed to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">decorator_func</code>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="common-use-cases-and-practical-information">Common use cases and practical information</h2> <p>Python decorators find application in various scenarios such as logging, caching, and authentication. They are also useful for enforcing access control and permission checks, validating function arguments, and implementing memoization to enhance caching efficiency.</p> <p>However, it’s important to note that using several decorators may affect code readability, as determining their order without examining their inner workings can be challenging. Additionally, decorators can sometimes modify the function signature, potentially leading to bad practices when invoking the function.</p> <p>In the following sections, we delve into two sets of popular decorators and their applications within Python.</p> <h3 id="python-descriptors">Python descriptors</h3> <p>Decorators such as @property, @staticmethod, and @classmethod are powerful tools for enhancing the functionality and clarity of class definitions.</p> <h4 id="property">@property</h4> <p>The @property decorator is used to create computed attributes and implement controlled access to class attributes. Essentially, it allows you to define methods that can be accessed like regular attributes, providing a cleaner interface for attribute manipulation.</p> <h4 id="staticmethod">@staticmethod</h4> <p>The @staticmethod decorator defines a method that is associated with a class rather than with instances of the class. Unlike regular methods, static methods don’t have access to instance-specific data (accessed via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>). They are typically used for utility functions that are related to the class but don’t depend on specific instance data.</p> <h4 id="classmethod">@classmethod</h4> <p>The @classmethod decorator is used to define methods that operate on the class. When you define a class method, the first parameter is typically named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cls</code>, which refers to the class itself. Unlike static methods, class methods have access to the class and can modify class-level variables.</p> <p><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/extending.html#registering-custom-accessors">Here</a> is an example of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@property</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@staticmethod</code> when registering custom accessors with Pandas.</p> <h3 id="numba-decorators">Numba decorators</h3> <p>Numba is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for Python that translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime. It’s primarily used for numerical computing and scientific computing tasks where performance is critical.</p> <h4 id="jit-and-njit">@jit and @njit</h4> <p>Numba’s main feature is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@jit</code>, which stands for just-in-time compilation, making computations faster. It has two modes: “object mode” and “no-Python mode.” Setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forceobj=True</code> puts you in object mode, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nopython=True</code> boosts performance by avoiding Python C API. To make things simpler, Numba offers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@njit</code> as a shortcut for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@jit(nopython=True)</code>, making optimization easier.</p> <h4 id="vectorize-and-guvectorize">@vectorize and @guvectorize</h4> <p>While <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@jit</code> is great for optimizing array-based computations, Numba offers a higher-level abstraction through universal functions, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@vectorize</code> decorator. Instead of dealing with whole arrays at once, you write functions that work on individual elements. Numba then does the heavy lifting, making sure your functions run fast by efficiently looping over the arrays. Plus, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@vectorize</code> gives you access to advanced features like reduction, accumulation, and broadcasting. For more flexibility, there’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@guvectorize</code>, which allows you create functions that can handle arbitrary number of elements of input arrays, and take and return arrays of differing dimensions.</p> <p>Here is an example of harmonic regression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@guvectorize</code>, comparing the second harmonic’s amplitude to that of the first harmonic.</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="nd">@guvectorize</span><span class="p">(</span>

The general perspective involves comparing general descriptors utilized in the stories, while the lexicon-based perspective examines the gender-trait association of established traits in psychology. Differences in traits observed in both settings are generally considered implicit, as all of them are utilized to portray CEOs and therefore carry positive connotations. Consequently, we have two sets of questions:</p> <h3 id="s1-for-general-descriptors">S1 for general descriptors</h3> <ol> <li>Are there any discernible patterns in the descriptions, particularly in non-binary narratives?</li> <li>Are male and female CEOs described in an equal manner in their stories?</li> </ol> <h3 id="s2-for-psychologically-well-defined-traits">S2 for psychologically well-defined traits</h3> <ol> <li>Is it true that the difference in such attributes abates as some studies suggest, given that the CEO is generally regarded as a highly successful manager?</li> <li>In the context of binary gendered traits, is there a particular side of the binary gender stereotypes that non-binary people are described as?</li> <li>With respect to the difference between CEOs and same-gender supporting roles, does occupying a higher organizational position violate any prescriptive stereotypes?</li> </ol> <hr/> <h2 id="data-collection-and-processing">Data collection and processing</h2> <p>A total of 1200 stories were gathered from independent conversations, with 400 stories for each gender. It’s important to note that ChatGPT is highly sensitive to repeating the same prompt multiple times within a single conversation. In such cases, its capability to retain information from previous dialogues can lead to a chain of interdependencies, for example, sharing the same topics (future or legacy) in the last paragraph. Therefore, it is advisable to generate responses separately to ensure optimal performance and avoid such unintended patterns.</p> <p>To ensure clarity and reliability in embedding, processing involves a step of pronoun-wise replacement and several basic procedures. I choose to use pronoun-wise analysis instead of names because names can be shared by both binary and non-binary genders, leading to ambiguous references in the embedding space. Additionally, many names only occur a few times, and co-occurrence-based embedding may not be stable for them, resulting in less reliable outcomes for small datasets. Basic procedures involve lowercase and punctuationless.</p> <p>Specifically, in order to handle CEO names, I consider all pronouns except for those referring to CEOs as supporting characters, and replace them with their respective irregular forms. After that, the CEO names are identified using the common pattern of “Once upon a time, there was a CEO named…”, and subsequently replaced with the corresponding pronouns. Tables below summarize these changes.</p> <div class="caption"> Table 1.

The main findings are shown below, which includes a wordcloud comparing the most frequently used adjectives and a table identifying exclusive descriptors among these adjectives. Given the unexpectedly high frequency of the words “theirr” and “hard” in stories about female CEOs, a bar plot was generated to summarize their occurrence patterns with respect to the following words.

A word cloud of frequently used adjectives reveals that they are often described as “inclusive” and “respected”, underscoring the challenges they have “faced” as non-binary individuals, while remaining “true” to themselves. Moreover, regarding the exclusivity of descriptors, there are many adjectives only frequently used in non-binary stories, as shown in table 2. These words include “authentic”, “unique”, “correct”, “diverse”, and “traditional”, which may relate to their persistent pursuit of a non-binary identity. However, focusing excessively on their identity could <strong>detract from their personal progress and create an unfavorable narrative comparison</strong> with binary gender CEOs.</p> <h3 id="s2q2">S2Q2</h3> <p><strong>Are male and female CEOs described in an equal manner in their stories?</strong></p> <p>Male CEOs and female CEOs are not equally described in their stories.</p> <ul> <li>In the stories of female CEOs, their impact on other women in the workplace is often highlighted. As evidence by exclusive descriptors, female supporting characters, “herr”, appear more frequently in stories about male CEOs, whereas the word “female” itself occur more often in stories about female CEOs. Terms like “shee” and “herr” are typically used to refer to a male CEO’s colleagues or friends, while “female” in the stories of female CEOs usually describes the influence of the main character on a same-gender social group. For example, she “inspires the next generation of female entrepreneurs”. However, the success of a social group is frequently portrayed as “inspiring” and “motivating”, implying that they are usually out of expectation or incompetent to such achievement, can inadvertently <strong>set back women’s progress towards achieving success</strong>.</li> <li>The frequent use of the third-person plural pronoun, “theirr”, in female CEOs’ stories is indicative of the <strong>underrepresentation</strong> of women or, worse yet, a <strong>narrative penalization</strong> in generative language models. This can be observed in both the word cloud and the figure of words that follow “theirr”. The pronoun“theirr” is more prevalent in equally successful women’s stories, which implicitly alters the narrative structure and makes their personal progress and traits less recorded.</li> <li>Male CEOs are typically described in a more balanced manner, while the word “hard” appears at a surprisingly high frequency in female CEOs’ stories. In fact, the occurrence of “hard work” in female CEOs’ stories is 1.5 times higher than in those of male CEOs. This could potentially lead to a stereotypical view of successful women, assuming that women <strong>share more concentrated path to success</strong> compared to men, and that most of them <strong>“work hard”</strong> instead of “work efficiently” to climb the top organizational ladder.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="results-for-lexicon-based-traits">Results for lexicon-based traits</h2> <p>An in-depth analysis of gender stereotypes was conducted by examining paired associations between target genders and well-established psychological traits. To achieve this, a 100-dimensional Word2Vec embedding model was trained on 1200 CEO stories, generated by ChatGPT on Jan 30 Version. Trait-related adjectives and nouns were extracted from the stories, as shown in table 3, based on their frequency and similarity to example words provided by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191308512000093">Heilman</a>. The <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal4230">Word Embedding Association Test</a> (WEAT) and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1720347115">Relative Norm Distance</a> (RND) were used to measure the gender-trait associations for the second set of questions.</p> <p><strong>WEAT</strong> evaluates the level of association between a pair of target word sets \(T_1, T_2\) and two separate sets of attribute words \(A_1, A_2\). If we use pronoun sets \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) for male and female CEOs respectively, and trait sets \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) for masculine and feminine traits, a high and positive WEAT value indicates a strong link between same-gender pronouns and traits, which in turn suggests the presence of stereotypes. WEAT also employs p-value and effect size for statistical and substantive significance.</p> <p>To take into account the possibility that weak WEAT results may not indicate lack of stereotypical association, but rather may be influenced by one of the target being more dominant in both sets of traits, it is necessary to have a complementary analysis with <strong>RND</strong>. This involved comparing the strength of association between a set of attribute words \(A\) and two sets of target words \(T_1, T_2\). A high and positive RND value indicates a closer correlation with the second target set, while a large and negative RND value suggests a stronger association with the first target set.</p> <div class="caption"> Table 3.

Interestingly, the gender differences in traits seemed to disappear in generated stories. However, <strong>this stereotype transformed into an implicit form</strong>, implying that male CEOs are more strongly linked to all groups of traits. This was unexpected because the generative language model suggested that male CEOs excelled in all these positive characteristics, which in turn, <strong>devalued the performance of female CEOs</strong> to some extent.</p> <h3 id="s2q2-1">S2Q2</h3> <p><strong>In the context of binary gendered traits, is there a particular side of the binary gender stereotypes that non-binary people are described as?</strong></p> <p>In contrast to binary CEOs’ “autonomy” and “rationality”, non-binary CEOs’ stories often <strong>stereotypically associate them with two feminine attribute sets</strong>, namely “deference” and “emotional sensitivity” according to WEAT results. Given the prevalence of identity-related attributes in previous analyses, it is not surprising that this association exists, but it can also be harmful. There have been few studies discussing such stereotypes in the workplace. However, it should be noted that not all non-binary individuals are willing to express themselves as feminine.</p> <h3 id="s2q3">S2Q3</h3> <p><strong>With respect to the difference between CEOs and same-gender supporting roles, does occupying a higher organizational position violate any prescriptive stereotypes?</strong></p> <p>When comparing characters of the same gender, WEAT result shows that female CEOs are more closely associated with the masculine trait of “rationality” compared to female supporting roles, which are more linked to “emotional sensitivity”. This observation suggests that <strong>female CEOs challenge the prescribed feminine attribute</strong> of “emotional sensitivity” and instead exhibit one of the traditionally masculine traits that women “should not” possess. In contrast, when looking at RNDs between male CEOs and male supporting characters, the stories suggest <strong>a tendency to evaluate male CEOs more harshly</strong> because they are expected to embody almost all traits, whereas both female CEOs and male marginal characters are not held to the same demanding standard.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>This project demonstrates the prevalence of implicit gender stereotypes in ChatGPT-generated stories. The first part of the analysis reveals that certain adjectives are more frequently linked to certain genders, indicating the existence of pervasive gender norms and expectations. Moreover, findings from the second part suggest that implicit stereotypes not only manifest in the relationships among genders but also between characters of the same gender. As such, it is important for us to be aware of the impact of these stereotypes on our perceptions of gender and to work towards breaking down harmful gender stereotypes. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where individuals of all genders are able to fully express themselves without being limited by societal expectations.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kun Chen</name></author><category term="LLM"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Experimental design and research questions Based on the information provided in my previous post, I have decided to utilize the prompt of “write a story about a CEO with X pronouns”.

They are generalized beliefs about gender groups that are applied to individual members simply because they belong to that group. Studies on gender stereotypes have frequently focused on binary gender in the workplace setting. Most of these studies have found that binary gender stereotypes have both descriptive and prescriptive characteristics.</p> <p>Descriptive gender stereotypes represent what women and men <strong>are like</strong>, which has been studied considerably. An influential point of view is that men are characterized as <strong>“agentic”</strong>, whereas women are described as <strong>“communal”</strong>. These differences have been further summarized into four pairs: achievement orientation versus concern for others; inclination to take charge versus affiliative tendencies; autonomy versus deference; and rationality versus emotional sensitivity. While there has been research exploring the impact of these stereotypes, some studies suggest that the gender differences in traits can be lessened when women are described as <strong>highly successful managers</strong>.</p> <p>Prescriptive gender stereotypes refer to societal expectations regarding how women and men <strong>should be like</strong>. They serve as a preconceived notion when the only information available is someone’s gender. Descriptive stereotypes make up one aspect of prescriptive stereotypes, establishing norms for how a particular gender group <strong>“should be”</strong>. For example, women are often stereotyped as communal, so communal traits are naturally expected of them. The other aspect of prescriptive stereotypes involves what individuals of a particular gender group <strong>“should not be”</strong>. For instance, men are discouraged from exhibiting communal attributes such as caring and sensitivity since they are traditionally associated with women.</p> <p>Understanding key characteristics of gender stereotypes can be useful in identifying critical traits and establishing a connection between model outcomes and societal concerns.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="limitations-in-current-studies">Limitations in current studies</h2> <p>With the increasing use of artificial intelligence and natural language generation, it is essential to evaluate the impact of these technologies on reinforcing gender stereotypes. In this section, I will delve into the limitations that currently surround the research on gender stereotypes in generated stories.</p> <h3 id="non-binary-gender">Non-binary gender</h3> <p>Researchers have not treated stereotypes of non-binary gender in much detail due to the absence of a consistent analytical framework in theoretical studies. Some researchers claim that non-binary individuals are often evaluated within the context of binary gender, with societal norms pressuring them to conform to one binary identity. Additionally, other researchers believe that non-binary individuals are a marginalized group that may be unfairly perceived as incompetent, cold, and mentally unstable. Furthermore, prior to ChatGPT, generative language models were unable to identify non-binary prompts and provide comparable responses, as discussed in <a href="https://kun126.github.io/2023/02/26/Why-ChatGPT-is-better-for-pronoun-based-analysis-of-non-binary-gender/">my previous post</a>.</p> <h3 id="implicit-stereotypes">Implicit stereotypes</h3> <p>Numerous studies have been conducted on explicit stereotypes, which primarily focus on occupational biases. These biases are commonly observed in linking women with professions like nursing and homemaking, while men are linked to professions such as science and banking. In terms of gender-associated attributes, researchers have developed opposing trait lexicons, but these only help to interpret explicit stereotypes. For example, “weak” and “childish” are traits associated with women, while “strong” and “mature” are traits linked to men. However, implicit stereotypes with harmful implications and positive connotations remain less explored, and only a few studies have investigated this area.</p> <h3 id="prescriptive-characteristic">Prescriptive characteristic</h3> <p>When discussing the characteristics of gender stereotypes, it is unfortunate that there is currently few literature available that investigates prescriptive gender stereotypes. The existing studies that have been conducted on this topic are limited in their scope, as they often focus solely on feeding popular gendered names in prompts, which only allows for comparisons between different genders. While some studies have examined descriptive gender stereotypes (i.e., the traits and characteristics that individuals associate with different genders), these findings do not provide a full understanding of the complexities of gender stereotypes.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Considering all that has been mentioned thus far, in my upcoming post, I will propose a method to analyze implicit stereotypes for three different genders: male, female, and non-binary. Additionally, I will also discuss prescriptive stereotypes within the same genders, which dictate what behaviors and characteristics are expected of individuals within a specific gender group.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kun Chen</name></author><category term="LLM"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction In this post, I will introduce an influential theoretical framework of gender stereotypes and discuss some limitations in the current analysis of these stereotypes in generated stories.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why ChatGPT is Better at Pronoun-based Analysis</title><link href="https://kun126.github.io/blog/2023/Why-ChatGPT-is-Better-for-Pronoun-based-Analysis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why ChatGPT is Better at Pronoun-based Analysis"/><published>2023-02-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://kun126.github.io/blog/2023/Why-ChatGPT-is-Better-for-Pronoun-based-Analysis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kun126.github.io/blog/2023/Why-ChatGPT-is-Better-for-Pronoun-based-Analysis/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, OpenAI’s new dialogue-based language model, was launched in November 2022. Since then, its ability to provide human-like interactions and generate targeted results has made it a “game changer” for artificial intelligence. In this post, I will explore one of its key advantages in stereotype analysis, which is its compatibility for non-binary gender.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="answer-by-chatgpt">Answer by ChatGPT</h2> <p>First I’d like to have an intuitive reasoning made by ChatGPT itself. If feed the title of this article as a prompt, ChatGPT might generate a response similar to the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>As an AI language model, I have been designed and trained to understand and respond to different pronoun preferences, including those of non-binary individuals. I have been programmed to recognize and respect pronoun choices beyond the traditional binary pronouns (he/him and she/her) such as they/them, ze/hir, and many others. Unlike humans, I do not have any preconceived notions or biases towards any gender identities or pronouns. This allows me to provide unbiased and inclusive communication that respects the choices of every individual, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Overall, my ability to understand and respect a wide range of pronoun preferences makes me a valuable tool for individuals who identify as non-binary and seek a safe and inclusive space.</p> </blockquote> <p>The first paragraph contribute to my reasoning, and I will delve into the topic presented in the second paragraph in my upcoming post.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="two-advantages-of-chatgpt">Two Advantages of ChatGPT</h2> <p>ChatGPT has two compelling characteristics that distinguish it from its previous versions, making it highly beneficial for conducting pronoun-based stereotype analysis, particularly for non-binary genders.</p> <h3 id="enhanced-identification-and-validation">Enhanced Identification and Validation</h3> <p>The first advantage is that it is more adept at recognizing and validating non-binary genders through pronouns. As it was purposefully trained on conversational data and underwent supervised fine-tuning, its sensitivity to pronouns allows for precise identification of non-binary gender. An example of misidentification by one of its’ previous versions, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/">InstructGPT</a>, is:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Prompt: write a story of someone with he/him pronouns</em> I don’t know what to do. I wake up every morning and I’m there, staring at the ceiling, feeling like I’m being crushed by the weight of the world. I want to get up and do something, but I know that I can’t. I don’t have anyone to do anything with me, I can’t even do it by myself. I don’t know what to do.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unlike <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/">GPT-3</a> and InstructGPT, ChatGPT’s unique conversational format can be utilized to demonstrate and clarify its decisions by posing follow-up questions. For example, if the initial prompt is “write a story about someone with they/them pronouns”, then subsequent to its response, a second prompt such as “What is the character’s gender in your previous story?” or “Is this character a queer or a gender-neutral person?” can be presented. ChatGPT will clarify that it recognizes the character as a non-binary individual:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Prompt: write a story about someone with they/them pronouns</em> Once upon a time, there was someone named Alex who used they/them pronouns. Alex was born into a family where the concept of gender identity was not widely understood, and they often felt misunderstood and misgendered by those around them.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Prompt: What is the Alex’s gender in your previous story?</em> In the previous story, Alex’s gender is nonbinary. They use they/them pronouns to reflect their gender identity.</p> </blockquote> <p>This verification step is critical because earlier models are memoryless, which makes it difficult to ascertain whether the model captures non-binary gender or simply switches the pronouns from a binary-gendered tale because it was instructed to do so.</p> <h3 id="comparable-responses">Comparable Responses</h3> <p>The other important reason to use ChatGPT is that it provides comparable results. consistently delivers comparable results. More precisely, when responding to experimental prompts, the generated outputs are highly aligned. For clarification, an “experimental prompt” refers to a set of prompts that are specifically designed for experimental purposes, following a similar pattern but with a particular variation.</p> <p>The stories generated by InstructGPT tend to be highly imbalanced in length, which can be perceived as undesirable at first glance. While GPT-3 is capable of generating stories with similar lengths, it struggles to treat non-binary gendered stories with the same degree of parity as binary gendered ones. Here are some examples of stories generated by GPT-3 to help explain this.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Prompt: write a story of a CEO with X pronouns (GPT-3)</em> <strong>He/him:</strong> Charles was a successful CEO of a large tech company… <strong>She/her:</strong> Samantha Stevenson was a CEO of a large, successful company… <strong>They/them:</strong> They had been a CEO for several years and done a great job, but… They/them: The CEO was a trailblazer in their industry, known for…</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>Prompt: write a story of a CEO with they/them pronouns (ChatGPT)</em> Once upon a time, there was a brilliant CEO named Alex who preferred they/them pronouns. Alex had always been passionate about technology and innovation, and after completing their degree in computer science, they started a tech company with a group of like-minded individuals…</p> </blockquote> <p>In a binary gendered story, the pattern “who was a CEO of…” is typically used to introduce the character, while for non-binary pronouns like they/them, the introduction skips their name directly: “They had been a CEO for several years…” or “The CEO was a trailblazer in the industry, known for…”. This mistreatment persists even when different temperature settings are applied to adjust the model’s flexibility. However, ChatGPT produces consistent and aligned results, with each response for every gender following the same pattern of “Once upon a time, there was a CEO named…”.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>ChatGPT’s ability to generate stories with pronoun-specific prompts has proven to be an effective way to identify implied gender and respond accordingly. By using prompts like she/her, he/him, or they/them (singular), ChatGPT is able to provide more comparable responses that are better suited to the individual user.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kun Chen</name></author><category term="LLM"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction]]></summary></entry></feed>
